# Full-Stack Contacts List application

I built a dynamic contact list web application from scratch, utilizing the power of Python with Flask for the backend and JavaScript with React for the frontend. This project showcases my full-stack development skills, integrating modern technologies to deliver a robust and user-friendly application.
Features:

User Authentication: Secure registration and login system to ensure that each user's contact list is private.    
CRUD Operations: Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete contacts seamlessly.
Search and Filter: Dynamic search and filter functionalities to easily locate specific contacts.
Responsive Design: Ensures compatibility across various devices and screen sizes for optimal user experience.
API Integration: Built RESTful APIs with Flask to handle all backend processes and data management.
State Management: Utilized React's state management to efficiently handle dynamic data and user interactions.

## Technologies Used:

Backend: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy (for database management)
Frontend: JavaScript, React, Axios (for API requests), CSS (for styling)
Database: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)

## Workflow:

Backend Development:
    Set up Flask server and created RESTful API endpoints.
    Implemented user authentication and authorization using Flask-Login.
    Designed the database schema with SQLAlchemy, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

Frontend Development:
    Developed the user interface with React, ensuring a responsive and intuitive design.
    Implemented state management to handle the dynamic nature of the contact list.
    Utilized Axios for making asynchronous API requests to the Flask backend.

Integration and Testing:
    Integrated the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth communication between the two layers.
    Conducted thorough testing to ensure functionality, usability, and performance.

This project not only demonstrates my technical proficiency but also my ability to deliver a complete, full-stack solution that meets modern web development standards.
